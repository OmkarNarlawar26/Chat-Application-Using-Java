# Chat-Application-Using-Java
This project is a Java-based Client–Server Chat Application developed using Swing for GUI and Socket Programming for communication. The server waits for client connections and enables real-time message exchange with a clean, dark-themed interface. Messages are visually distinguished using bold labels and color styling for better readability.
